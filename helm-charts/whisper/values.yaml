  # Choose where to save your downloaded models
  # Set modelUseHostPath for local directory, this is good for one node test. Example:
  # modelUseHostPath: /mnt/opea-models
  # Set modelUsePVC for PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC), which is suitable for multinode deployment. Example:
  # modelUsePVC: model-volume

  # By default, both var are set to empty, the model will be downloaded and saved to a tmp volume.
