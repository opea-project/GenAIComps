# TTS Microservice

TTS (Text-To-Speech) microservice helps users convert text to speech. When building a talking bot with LLM, users might need an LLM generated answer in audio format. This microservice is built for that conversion stage.

# ðŸš€1. Start Microservice with Python (Option 1)

To start the TTS microservice, you need to first install python packages.

## 1.1 Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 1.2 Start TTS Service with Python Script

```bash
python tts.py
```

# ðŸš€2. Start Microservice with Docker (Option 2)

Alternatively, you can start the ASR microservice with Docker.

## 2.1 Build Docker Image

```bash
cd ../../
docker build -t opea/tts:latest --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/tts/Dockerfile .
```

## 2.2 Run Docker with CLI

```bash
docker run -p 9999:9999 --network=host --ipc=host -e http_proxy=$http_proxy -e https_proxy=$https_proxy opea/tts:latest
```

# ðŸš€3. Consume TTS Service

You can use the following `curl` command to test whether the service is up. Notice that the first request can be slow because it needs to download the models.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9999/v1/audio/speech \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"   \
    -d '{"text":"Hello there."}'
```
