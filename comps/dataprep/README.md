# Dataprep Microservice

The Dataprep Microservice aims to preprocess the data from various sources (either structured or unstructured data) to text data, and convert the text data to embedding vectors then store them in the database.

## Install Requirements

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install libreoffice
```

## Use LVM (Large Vision Model) for Summarizing Image Data

Occasionally unstructured data will contain image data, to convert the image data to the text data, LVM can be used to summarize the image. To leverage LVM, please refer to this [readme](../lvms/src/README.md) to start the LVM microservice first and then set the below environment variable, before starting any dataprep microservice.

```bash
export SUMMARIZE_IMAGE_VIA_LVM=1
```

## Running in the air gapped environment

The following steps are common for running the dataprep microservice in an air gapped environment (a.k.a. environment with no internet access), for all DB backends.

1. Download the following models, e.g. `huggingface-cli download --cache-dir <model data directory> <model>`

- microsoft/table-transformer-structure-recognition
- timm/resnet18.a1_in1k
- unstructuredio/yolo_x_layout

2. launch the `dataprep` microservice with the following settings:

- mount the `model data directory` as the `/data` directory within the `dataprep` container
- set environment variable `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` to 1 when launching the `dataprep` microservice

e.g. `docker run -d -v <model data directory>:/data -e HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 ... ...`
