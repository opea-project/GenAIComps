# Prediction Guard Introduction

[Prediction Guard](https://docs.predictionguard.com) allows you to utilize hosted open access LLMs, LVMs, and embedding functionality with seamlessly integrated safeguards. In addition to providing a scalable access to open models, Prediction Guard allows you to configure factual consistency checks, toxicity filters, PII filters, and prompt injection blocking. Join the [Prediction Guard Discord channel](https://discord.gg/TFHgnhAFKd) and request an API key to get started.

# Getting Started

## üöÄ1. Start Microservice with Docker üê≥ 

### 1.1 Set up Prediction Guard API Key

You can get your API key from the [Prediction Guard Discord channel](https://discord.gg/TFHgnhAFKd).
```bash
export PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

###  1.2 Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t opea/llm-docsum-predictionguard:latest -f comps/llms/summarization/predictionguard/Dockerfile .
```

### 1.3 Run the Predictionguard Microservice

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -e PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY=$PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY  --name llm-docsum-predictionguard opea/llm-docsum-predictionguard:latest
```

## üöÄ 2. Consume the Prediction Guard Microservice

See the [Prediction Guard docs](https://docs.predictionguard.com/) for available model options.
