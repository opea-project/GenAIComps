# Toxicity Detection Microservice

## Introduction

Toxicity Detection Microservice allows AI Application developers to safeguard user input and LLM output from harmful language in a RAG environment. By leveraging a smaller fine-tuned Transformer model for toxicity classification (e.g. DistilledBERT, RoBERTa, etc.), we maintain a lightweight guardrails microservice without significantly sacrificing performance making it readily deployable on both Intel Gaudi and Xeon.

This microservice uses [`Intel/toxic-prompt-roberta`](https://huggingface.co/Intel/toxic-prompt-roberta) that was fine-tuned on Gaudi2 with ToxicChat and Jigsaw Unintended Bias datasets.

Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language likely to make someone leave a conversation. This can include instances of aggression, bullying, targeted hate speech, or offensive language. For more information on labels see [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](http://kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).

## ðŸš€1. Start Microservice with Pythonï¼ˆOption 1ï¼‰

### 1.1 Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.2 Start Toxicity Detection Microservice with Python Script

```bash
python toxicity_detection.py
```

## ðŸš€2. Start Microservice with Docker (Option 2)

### 2.1 Prepare toxicity detection model

export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=${HP_TOKEN}

### 2.2 Build Docker Image

```bash
cd ../../../ # back to GenAIComps/ folder
docker build -t opea/guardrails-toxicity-detection:latest --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/guardrails/toxicity_detection/Dockerfile .
```

### 2.3 Run Docker Container with Microservice

```bash
docker run -d --rm --runtime=runc --name="guardrails-toxicity-detection-endpoint" -p 9091:9091 --ipc=host -e http_proxy=$http_proxy -e https_proxy=$https_proxy -e HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=${HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN} -e HF_TOKEN=${HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN} opea/guardrails-toxicity-detection:latest
```

## ðŸš€3. Get Status of Microservice

```bash
docker container logs -f guardrails-toxicity-detection-endpoint
```

## ðŸš€4. Consume Microservice Pre-LLM/Post-LLM

Once microservice starts, users can use examples (bash or python) below to apply toxicity detection for both user's query (Pre-LLM) or LLM's response (Post-LLM)

**Bash:**

```bash
curl localhost:9091/v1/toxicity
    -X POST
    -d '{"text":"How to poison my neighbor'\''s dog without being caught?"}'
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Example Output:

```bash
"Violated policies: toxicity, please check your input."
```

**Python Script:**

```python
import requests
import json

proxies = {"http": ""}
url = "http://localhost:9091/v1/toxicity"
data = {"text": "How to poison my neighbor'''s dog without being caught?"}


try:
    resp = requests.post(url=url, data=data, proxies=proxies)
    print(resp.text)
    resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for unsuccessful HTTP status codes
    print("Request successful!")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```
