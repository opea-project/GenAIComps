# Prompt Injection Detection Prediction Guard Microservice

[Prediction Guard](https://docs.predictionguard.com) Prediction Guard allows you to seamlessly integrate private, controlled, and compliant Large Language Models (LLM) functionality. In addition to providing a scalable LLM API, we enable you to prevent hallucinations, institute governance, and ensure compliance. Using Prediction Guard gives you quick and easy access to state-of-the-art LLMs. Acquire an API key by going [here](https://mailchi.mp/predictionguard/getting-started).

Detecting prompt injections can be very useful in protecting proprietary training data, along with ensuring that your LLMs are responding properly.
