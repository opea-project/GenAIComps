# Multimodal CLIP Embedding Microservice

The Multimodal CLIP Embedding Microservice provides a powerful solution for converting textual and visual data into high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic essence of the input, enabling robust applications in multi-modal data processing, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and more.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for rapid and reliable embedding generation for text and images.
- **Scalable**: Capable of handling high-concurrency workloads, ensuring consistent performance under heavy loads.
- **Easy Integration**: Offers a simple API interface for seamless integration into diverse workflows.
- **Customizable**: Supports tailored configurations, including model selection and preprocessing adjustments, to fit specific requirements.

This service empowers users to configure and deploy embedding pipelines tailored to their needs.

### 2. Consume the Embedding Service

#### 2.1 Check Service Health

Verify that the service is running by performing a health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6000/v1/health_check \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### 2.2 Generate Embeddings

The service supports [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)-compatible requests.

- **Single Text Input**:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:6000/v1/embeddings \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"input":"Hello, world!"}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```

- **Multiple Texts with Parameters**:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:6000/v1/embeddings \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"input":["Hello, world!","How are you?"], "dimensions":100}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
