# GenAIComps

GenAIComps provides a suite of microservices, leveraging a service composer to assemble a mega-service tailored for real-world Enterprise AI applications, all rigorously validated on Intel platforms.

Its advantages include:

- Streamlined containerization and orchestration of services and models, ensuring concurrency and scalability.
- Deployment of applications composed of multiple microservices, each capable of independent containerization and scaling.
- Effortless transition from local development to serving via the mega-service, followed by seamless readiness for production using Docker containers.
